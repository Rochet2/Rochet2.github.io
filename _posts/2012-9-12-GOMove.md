Original idea by [Mordred](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0JVXJ07KUU)  
GOMove allows the spawning and moving of gameobjects without actually being at the location of the object.  
Other main differences to other gameobject tools are:

 * mass moving of gameobjects
 * various selection lists
 * saves guids by using fake temporary guids for unsaved objects
