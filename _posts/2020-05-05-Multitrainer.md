The patch was coded originally by CyberMist2.

Multitrainer is a core modification which allows the player to access multiple trainer views from a single NPC.  
Using this method you can create unlimited amount of trainer views.  

The core modification allows the creation of multiple trainer windows through the default database gossip tables as well as through C++.  
You can also mix any other gossip options with the Multitrainer gossip options.  
The spell lists for the trainer windows are stored in `trainer_spell` as usual.
