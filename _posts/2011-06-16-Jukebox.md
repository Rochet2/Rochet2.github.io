Jukebox is a music playing NPC.  
It has different zone musics and ambients as well as songs and event musics. You can also view four movies.  
In total there are 600+ sounds including Ulduar, Icecrown and capital city zone musics.  
The names of the songs are the original song file names.  

The downloads include version for TrinityCore and MaNGOS as well as a list of possible sound IDs.
Deleting the default installation can be done with the deletion SQL included with the installation SQL.  
The jukebox is completely created with SQL which means **you can install and edit it without recompiling your core**.
