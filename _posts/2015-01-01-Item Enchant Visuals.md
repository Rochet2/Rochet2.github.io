Original idea by Nerc at AC-web
Item enchant visuals adds functionality for adding enchant visuals to items.  
By default the scripts utilize this new feature by adding a 25% chance to apply a random enchant visual to looted weapons.  

Enchanting will erase the visual. In total there are 38 different visuals.
