<h1>Dress NPC:</h1>
<div class="box">
<p>Allows you to equip <b>gear</b> on NPCs.</p>
<p>Usually you need a patch to make new NPC models and such.</p>
<p>Through some core editing and the mage spell "mirror image" mechanic I made it possible to dress NPCs with gear.</p>
<p>This does not require ANY client modification or addons or anything.</p>
<p>Set the displays of items you want NPC to have and his race and gender as well as facial features and skin color.</p>
<p>All this is done in the database.</p>
<br />
<p>Note that the items are DISPLAYIDS!! Not item entries.</p>
<p>Remember to clear cache when using on an npc :3</p>
