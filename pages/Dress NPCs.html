<h1>Dress NPCs</h1>
<p>
Allows you to equip <b>gear</b> on NPCs. No client modifications!
</p>
<p>Set the displays of items you want NPC to have and his race and gender as well as facial features and skin color. All this is done in the database.</p>
<p>Note that the items are displayids, not item entries. Remember to clear cache when using on an npc :3</p>
